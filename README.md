Data Wrangling and Preparation with Programming - Tweets Affecting Bitcoin Prices

Project aims to determine whether twitter tweets, more specially words within each tweet, influence bitcoin prices. Datasets are obtained from Kaggle and Federal Reserve Economic Data. Data wrangling and preparation skills in python programming are demonstrated through data pre-processing (cleaning, editing, merging, transforming between structured and unstructured data, and simple natural language processing) before identifying those significant words that affect bitcoin prices.
