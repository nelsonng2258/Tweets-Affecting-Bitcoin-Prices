Data Wrangling and Preparation with Programming - Tweets Affecting Bitcoin Prices

Project aims to determine whether twitter tweets, more specifically keywords within each tweet, influence bitcoin prices. Datasets are obtained from Kaggle and Federal Reserve Economic Data. Data wrangling and preparation skills in python programming are demonstrated through data pre-processing (cleaning, editing, merging, transforming between structured and unstructured data, and simple natural language processing) before identifying those significant words that affect bitcoin prices.

Owing to Github size limit, the project has to be uploaded to Google Drive instead. Click <b>[here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1a1phKW5u2E70kRPEufCCluQaegW14FVO?usp=sharing)</b> to go to the Google Drive and download Python project.

Items to download to run the program:
1. Data folder (with Bitcoin_tweets.csv and CBBTCUSD.csv)
2. Structured Data folder (empty folder)
3. Unstructured Data folder (empty folder)
4. my_Functions_btc_clean.py
5. my_Functions_btc_graph.py
6. my_Functions_btc_wrangle.py
